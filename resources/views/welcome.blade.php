                <p>Thank you Xceed Electrical for installing our new TV. Looking forward to getting our videos and resources playing for our community.<br id="test signiatures"> Western Sydney MRC</p>
                <p>We have been a customer of Xceed Electrical since 2013 and have always found them to be an excellent and efficient contractor. 
                They are very professional in their approach to any jobs they are asked to do and all jobs undertaken have been completed to an exceptionally high standard and they are always willing to visit site immediately if an emergency arises. I would have no hesitation in recommending Xceed Electrical for any electrical repairs or installations.<br> Mouna Diani</p>
                <p>Just want to give residents a heads up. Xceed Electrical has installed cameras, a doorbell, internet cables, downlights and power points for me. They are honest, reliable and really lovely guys. Don't hesitate to call if you want quality work. Jayson and his team are great. <br> Sallyanne Jean</p>
